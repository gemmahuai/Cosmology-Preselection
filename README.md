# Cosmology-Preselection
color-magnitude cut for the SPHEREx cosmology preselection (Nov 15th, 2024) 

Several notes: 

* Goal: try to place some color-magnitude cut to select sources that will give good redshift estimate for downstream cosmology study

* This is a preselection cut only using Legacy Survey (LS) z-band and WISE 1 band photometry. Future selections will possibly employ more complicated cuts. 

* Please follow the jupyter notebook for further details. To reproduce the results, simply pull the jupyter notebook and the cross-matched catalog (between COSMOS 166k and SPHEREx refcat v0.6), and rerun the notebook. Or, Stats are summarized at the bottom of the notebook.
